SlimLinux - A Micro-Linux for building IoT & Embedded Applications
==================================================================

SlimLinux is a Linux server development kit for the purpose of
developing small lightweight, secure Linux based embedded
applications – both physical & virtual. The base installation
takes 16Mb of disk space and uses 20Mb of RAM to run.

An “embedded application” means any Linux system that is
intended to run “headless” (no screen) with almost exclusively
unattended operation. So this includes, but is not limited to, IoT,
network applications (Routers, Firewalls etc), Internet servers
(real or VM), industrial applications, automotive applications,
intelligent devices, home & industrial automation, basically
anywhere you want to be able to put in a relatively sophisticated
network capable computer that will run continuously without the
need for human intervention.

SlimLinux is not a distribution, in itself, but is an operating
system design that uses other Linux distributions as its base. This
means you can copy binaries and libraries directly from the base
distribution and they will run on your SlimLinux.

Because SlimLinux is a very cut-down operating system, if you do
copy binaries from other distributions, you may also need to copy
libraries and static configuration files that are required to
support the binary you have copied over. 

Our design philosophy has been to copy over as little as possible.
All you need for a minimal Linux system is a kernel, some basic
libs, and busybox – so that's about all you get in our base O/S.

Current binary base distributions supported are
	Slackware x64 v14.2
	Redhat x64 v7.5

We have been running public facing internet server applications,
based on Slackware SlimLinux, on both physical & virtual servers
for over 10 years, and would expect an “uptime” of between 3 &
4 years – i.e. running 3 to 4 years between reboots.
Because it is so small, SlimLinux enables you to run each of your
server applications on a different VM instance – this massively
improves security without being as wasteful of resources as using a
full standard install.

When you look at the “Redhat” or “Slackware” SlimLinux you
will not see is an operating system that looks like what it is
based on. The base gives the SlimLinux full binary compatibility
with the base, but the structure of the system and what utilities
are available will be different.
