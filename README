What is SlimLinux

SlimLinux is a Linux server development kit for the purpose of developing small lightweight, secure
Linux servers particularly for use in embedded environments – both for physical and virtual
servers.

SlimLinux is not a distribution, in itself, but is an operating system design that uses other Linux
distributions as its base. This means you can copy binaries and libraries directly from the base
distribution and they will run on your SlimLinux.

Because SlimLinux is a very cut-down operating system, if you do copy binaries from other
distributions, you may also need to copy libraries and static configuration files that are required
to support the binary you have copied over. Our design philosophy has been to copy over as little as
possible. All you need for a minimal Linux server is a kernel, some basic libs, and busybox – so
that's about all you get in our base O/S.

The term “server” is used to mean any Linux system that is intended to run “headless” (no
console) with almost exclusively unattended operation.

So this includes, but is not limited to, network applications (Routers, Firewalls etc), Internet
servers (real or VM), industrial applications, automotive applications, intelligent devices, home &
industrial automation, basically anywhere you want to be able to put in a relatively sophisticated
network capable computer that will run continuously without the need for constant intervention.

We have been running public facing internet server applications, based on SlimLinux, on Linux/KVM VM
Host & Guest servers for some considerable time, and would expect an “uptime” of between 3 & 4
years – i.e. running 3 to 4 years between reboots.

SlimLinux enables you to run each of your server applications on a different VM instance – this
massively improves security without being as wasteful of resources as using a full standard install.
