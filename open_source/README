These are the names of the source files that were downloaded
to create executables and libraries that were not taken from
the base distribution.

Including access to this source code is a condition of most
open source lisences.

We would have included the actual files themselves, but
github *really* doesn't like you including large files
and there is a size limit on each project.

However, if you google these file names, getting the 
original file isn't hard.

If you are having trouble finding any, please ask and we
can get you a copy - no problems.
