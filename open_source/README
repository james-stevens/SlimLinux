This are the names of the source files that were downloaded
to create executables and libraries that were not taken from
the base distribution.

We would have included the actual files themselves, but
github *really* doesn't like you including large files
and there is a size limit on each project.

However, if you google these file names, getting the 
original file isn't hard.
