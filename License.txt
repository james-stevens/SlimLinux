SlimLinux is released as open source under the license GPLv3.

You are free to do whatever you like with the software, but all 
modifications, enhancements, bug fixes to any part of the works 
must be made public as well as any additional features / binary 
bases / overlays that depend on, or make use of, the open source
code.

All projects that are based on SlimLinux, or use any parts of 
SlimLinux, must be fully open source and made free under GPLv3.

If you wish to use SlimLinux as part of a proprietary product, and
so do not wish to publish the source code to that product, other 
license terms are available. Closed source projects based on 
SlimLinux are not permitted under the terms of this open source 
license.

Developers that submit changes, updates, enhancements etc, agree
that their code will always be released as open source under 
GPLv3, as well as being included in alternative closed source 
license terms offered to third parties.

We totally respect all developers who do not wish to agree to 
this but, due to pre-existing agreements, we can not integrate 
their code in the master branch. 

This is commonly referred to "selling exceptions" and there 
are mixed feelings about it in the open source community. 
However, where it enables businesses to sustain open source 
projects it will probably continue to be part of the industry.
